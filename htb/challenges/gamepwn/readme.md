# cubemadness1

Most unity games are developed with C# which can be de-compiled directly using dnSpy by dropping the executable or the GameAssembly.dll file,But in this case the game assembly was actually build with il2cpp which converts C# code to C++ which is actually used by developers to stop reverse engineering and leaking their gameâ€™s source code.

this cubemadness1 would require the use of cheat engine.

solved using cheat engine
