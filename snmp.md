# SNMP

SNMP, which stands for Simple Network Management Protocol, is a communication protocol that lets you monitor managed network devices including Routers, Switches, Servers, Printers and other devices that are IP enabled all through a single management system/software.

# What does SNMP do?

Monitor inbound and outbound Traffic flowing through the device
Early Detection of faults within network devices along with Alerts/Notifications
Analyzing data collected from devices over long periods of time to identify bottlenecks and performance issues
Ability to remotely configure compatible devices
Access and Control devices remotely that are connected via SNMP.

## Enumeration

SNMP enumeration is used to enumerate user accounts, passwords, groups, system names, devices on a target system.

It consists of three major components:

Managed Device: A managed device is a device or a host (technically known as a node) which has the SNMP service enabled. These devices could be routers, switches, hubs, bridges, computers etc.

Agent: An agent can be thought of as a piece of software that runs on a managed device. Its primary job is to convert the information into SNMP compatible format for the smooth management of the network using SNMP protocol.

Network Management System (NMS): These are the software systems that are used for monitoring of the network devices
